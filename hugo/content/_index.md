# Tillitis TKey Developer Handbook

Welcome to the TKey Developer Handbook. With this handbook, you can
learn how to build and use current TKey (on-)device applications, as
well as their corresponding client applications which run on the
computer where the TKey is plugged in (sometimes called the "host").
Additionally, in this developer handbook, you can learn how to develop
your own applications.

The source for this living documentation resides in a <a
href="https://github.com/tillitis/dev-tillitis">repository</a> on
GitHub. You're welcome to contribute by submitting a Pull request, for
example using the convenient "Edit this page" button at the bottom of
every page.
