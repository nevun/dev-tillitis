# Memory Map

## Addressing

Layout of a 32-bit address:

```
31st bit                              0th bit
v                                     v
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

- Bits [31 .. 30] (2 bits): Top level prefix (described below)
- Bits [29 .. 24] (6 bits): Core select. There is space for 64 cores.
- Bits [23 ..  0] (24 bits): Actual memory or in-core address.


## Assigned Top Level Prefixes

The first 2 bits in a 32-bit address.

| *name*   | *prefix* | *address length*                     |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| ROM      | 0b00     | 30 bit address                       |
| RAM      | 0b01     | 30 bit address                       |
| reserved | 0b10     |                                      |
| MMIO     | 0b11     | 6 bits for core select, 24 bits rest |

## Address Prefixes

The first 8 bits in a 32-bit address.

| *name*      | *prefix* |
|-------------|----------|
| ROM         | 0x00     |
| RAM         | 0x40     |
| MMIO        | 0xc0     |
| MMIO TRNG   | 0xc0     |
| MMIO TIMER  | 0xc1     |
| MMIO UDS    | 0xc2     |
| MMIO UART   | 0xc3     |
| MMIO TOUCH  | 0xc4     |
| MMIO FW_RAM | 0xd0     |
| MMIO TK1    | 0xff     |

## MMIO

MMIO begins at `0xc000_0000` but please use the constants in
[tk1_mem.h](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-libs/blob/main/include/tk1_mem.h)
in the `tkey-libs` repository.

*Note*: MMIO accesses should be 32 bits wide. Use for example `lw` and
`sw` to load and store 32-bit words. Exceptions are `FW_RAM` and
`QEMU_DEBUG`.

In the following table, *r* equals read and *r/w* equals read and
write access.

| *Name*            | *FW*  | *App*     | *Size* | *Type*   | *Content* | *Description*                                                           |
